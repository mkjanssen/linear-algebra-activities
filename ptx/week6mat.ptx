  		As usual, we should set up our working environment. There should be no output.
  	</p>

	<sage>
      <input>
        M = MatrixSpace(QQ,3,3)
        I = M(1)

 	<title>Exploring Symmetry</title>
 	
 	
    

 	
 	
 <exploration>
 
 	<statement>
 		Create two symmetric matrices (probably of different sizes, just to be safe). Use the <c>.inverse()</c> command to find their inverses. What do you notice? What do you wonder?
 		<sage>
 		
 		</sage>
</statement>
</exploration>


 <exploration>
 
 	<statement>
 		Create a matrix <m>A</m>. Use the <c>.transpose()</c> command and multiply <m>A A^T</m> and <m>A^T A</m>. What do you notice? What do you wonder?
 		<sage>
 		
 		</sage>
</statement>
</exploration>



<p>
	An advantage of working with symmetric matrices is in the elimination process. We really only need to work with half of the matrix (plus the main diagonal)! So let's see how symmetric matrices carry through to the <m>LDU</m> factorization.
</p>

<exploration>
	<statement>
	Consider the matrix <m>B</m> below.
	
	<ol>
		<li>Confirm that <m>B</m> is symmetric by using the <c>.is_symmetric()</c> command.</li>
		<li>Capture the matrices <m>P</m>, <m>L</m>, and <m>U</m>, using <c>P, L, U = B.LU(pivot='nonzero')</c>. Confirm that no row swaps were needed.</li>
		<li>Find the diagonal matrix <m>D</m> and a new matrix <m>U_{\text{new}}</m> that satisfies <m>B = LDU_{\text{new}}</m>.</li>
		<li>What do you notice? Choose a different symmetric matrix and run the calculations again to see if the same behavior persists.</li>
	</ol>

	<sage>
        <input>
          B = M([2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1])
          B
        </input>     
      </sage>
      </statement>
      
</exploration>


<subsection>
	<title>Fun with Permutations</title>

<exploration>
<statement>
	Strang writes <m>PA = LU</m>, but Sage calculates the <m>P</m> that satisfies <m>A = PLU</m>. Let's explore their relationship (though maybe you know what it is already?).
	
	<ol>
		<li>
			Given the <m>A</m> below, use <c>P, L, U = A.LU()</c> to calculate an <m>LU</m> decomposition.
		</li>
		<li>Confirm that <m>A = PLU</m>.</li>
		<li>What permutation matrix <m>P'</m> satisfies <m>P' A = LU</m>? Confirm it in Sage.</li>
		
	</ol>
	
	<sage>
        <input>
        	A = M([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
          
        </input>
    </sage>
</statement>
</exploration>


<p>
	To close the section, let's put everything together in an exploration of the deep structure of a system of equations.
	
</p>


<exploration>

	<statement>
		 Consider the following system of 3 linear equations in 3 unknowns.
        <me>\left\{
        \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
        -x &amp; - &amp; 2y &amp; + &amp; 2z &amp; = &amp; 1 \\
        2x &amp; + &amp; 4y &amp; - &amp; z &amp; = &amp; 5 \\
        x &amp; - &amp; 2y &amp; - &amp; 3z &amp; = &amp; 3
        \end{array}\right.
        </me>
        
        
        <sage>
	        	<input>
        			A=M([-1,-2,2,2,4,-1,1,-2,-3])
        			B=matrix(3,4,[-1,-2,2,1,2,4,-1,5,1,-2,-3,3])
        			b=matrix(3,1,[1,5,3])
        			PT, L, Uold = A.LU()
        			P=PT.transpose()
   			</input>    
        </sage>
        
        <ol>
        
        	<li>Find <m>D</m> and <m>U</m> so that you can write <m>PA = LDU</m> and <m>A = P^T LDU</m>.</li>
        <li>	Multiply <m>P b</m> to get <m>b'</m>.</li>
        
        <li>Solve <m>Lc = b'</m>.</li>
        
        <li>Solve <m>Dy=c</m>.</li>
        <li>Now solve the upper-triangular system <m>Ux = y</m>.</li>
        	<li>What is the solution to the original system?</li>
        	<li>Confirm your solution by using Sage's <c>.rref()</c> command on an appropriate matrix.</li>
        </ol>

<statement>
        These are true or false questions. If the statement is true, explain why
        you know it is true. If the statement is false, give an example that
        shows it is false.
        <ol>
          <li>
            The block matrix <m>\left( \begin{smallmatrix} A &amp; 0 \\
            0 &amp; A \end{smallmatrix}\right)</m> is automatically symmetric.

            If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are symmetric, then their product <m>AB</m>
            is symmetric.

            If <m>A</m> is not symmetric, then <m>A^{-1}</m> is not symmetric.

            <m>A</m> can be factored into <m>LDL^T</m>, but not into

	<title>Column Spaces and Sage</title>
	
	<p>
	Sage can work with vector spaces! Let's set up our workspace.
	</p>
	<sage>
      <input>
        V = VectorSpace(QQ, 3)
        V
      </input>
      <output>Vector space of dimension 3 over Rational Field</output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      This is like the <c>MatrixSpace</c> construction we have seen before.
      <c>V</c> is now the collection of all vectors of size <m>3</m> with
      rational numbers as entries.
    </p>
	
	<exploration>
	
		<statement>
			Let's see how to get column spaces from Sage.
			First, let's define a <m>2\times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m>.
			<sage>
      <input>
        A = matrix(QQ, 2,3, [4,5,3,0,1,1])
        A
      </input>
      
    </sage>
    Now, we get the column space.
    <sage>
      <input>
        A.column_space()
      </input>
      
    </sage>
    <p>
      Note that SageMath gives information in terms of a basis. We will talk about
      this concept soon.
    </p>
    
    Compute the column space of <m>B</m> below. What do you notice? What do you wonder?
    
    <sage>
      <input>
        B = matrix(QQ, 3,3 , [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
        B
      </input>
    </sage>
    
     <p>
      SageMath prefers to display vectors as rows! This is a big interal preference.
      We just have to get over it. Well, we have to <em>remember it</em> and get over it.
      To access the basis vectors and display them as columns,
      we will use the following:
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        B.column_space().basis()[0].column() # first basis vector
      </input>
      
    </sage>
    <sage>
      <input>
        B.column_space().basis()[1].column() # second basis vector
      </input>
      
    </sage>
    
		</statement>
	
	</exploration>
	
	
<exploration>
      <statement>
        Find an example of a vector which is not in the column space of the
        matrix <me>
        C = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1  \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix},
        </me> or explain why that is not possible. Here's a Sage cell if it's helpful:
        <sage>
				<input>
					C = matrix(2,2,[2,1,1,1])
					C.column_space()
				</input>
