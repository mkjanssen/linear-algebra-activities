    <title>The Determinant</title>
    <p>
      Generally, the most interesting matrices to look at are the square ones.
      For square matrices, there is an important number called the
      <term>determinant</term> which helps us determine if the matrix is
      invertible or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strang lists 10 important properties of determinants in this section,
      and verifies them for <m>2\times 2</m> matrices. The verifications for
      general matrices aren't any harder, but they sure are <emph>longer</emph>,
      so I am glad he skipped them. Anyway, these properties are enough to get
      by when it is time to compute. In fact, clever use of these properties
      can save you a lot of time.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The determinant of the identity matrix is always one: <m>\det(I)=1</m>.</li>
      <li>If we exchange two rows of a matrix, the determinant changes sign.</li>
      <li>The determinant is linear in each row separately. (The fancy new word
        here is that <m>\det</m> is a <term>multilinear</term> function.)</li>
      <li>If two rows are equal, then the determinant is zero.</li>
      <li>The row operation of <q>add a multiple of one row to another row</q>
        does not change the determinant of a matrix.</li>
      <li>If a matrix has a row of zeros, then its determinant is zero.</li>
      <li>If <m>A</m> is triangular, then <m>\det(A)</m> is the product of the
        diagonal entries of <m>A</m>.</li>
      <li>A matrix is singular if its deterimant is zero. A matrix is invertible
        exactly when its determinant is non-zero.</li>
      <li>The determinant is a <term>multiplicative</term> function at the level
      of matrices: <m>\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)</m>.</li>
      <li>The determinant of a matrix and its transpose are the same.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That last property can be helpful in a variety of ways: it allows us to translate
      all of those statements about rows into statements about columns!
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Sage and the Determinant</title>
    <p>Sage has a built-in command for the determinant of a square matrix. It is
      just what you expect: <c>A.determinant()</c>.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        A = matrix(QQ, 3,3, [4,3,5, 2,-1,0, -5,2,10])
        A
      </input>
      <output>
        [ 4  3  5]
        [ 2 -1  0]
        [-5  2 10]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>To be sure that this works properly, we can do it the old way, too:</p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        P, L, U = A.LU(pivot="nonzero")
        print(P)
        print(L)
        print(U)
      </input>
      <output>
        [1 0 0]
        [0 1 0]
        [0 0 1]
        [     1      0      0]
        [   1/2      1      0]
        [  -5/4 -23/10      1]
        [   4    3    5]
        [   0 -5/2 -5/2]
        [   0    0 21/2]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      Clearly, there are no row swaps used, so it is easy to see that
      <m>\det(A) = 4\cdot (-5/2)\cdot (21/2) = -105</m>.

  	<title>(Strang Ex 5.1.1)</title>
      <statement>
        If a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix <m>A</m> has <m>\det(A) = 1/2</m>, find
        <ol>
          <li><m>\det(2A)</m>,</li>
          <li><m>\det(-A)</m>, and</li>
          <li><m>\det(A^2)</m>.</li>
        </ol>
        Explain which properties of determinants you need to make your deductions.
      </statement>
    </exploration>

    <exploration>
    <title>(Strang Ex 5.1.2)</title>
      <statement>
        If a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix has <m>\det(A) = -1</m>, find
        <ol>
          <li><m>\det(\frac{1}{2}A)</m>,</li>
          <li><m>\det(-A)</m>,</li>
          <li><m>\det(A^2)</m>, and </li>
          <li><m>\det(A^{-1})</m></li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </exploration>

    <exploration>
    <title>(Strang Ex 5.1.10)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>A</m> is a matrix with the property that the entries in
          each of its rows add to zero. Solve the equation <m>Ax = 0</m> to prove
          that <m>\det(A)=0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then suppose that instead the entries in each row add to one. Show that
          <m>\det(A-I)=0</m>. Does this mean that <m>\det(A) = 1</m>? Give an example
          or an argument.
        </p>
      </statement>

    	<title>(Strang Ex 5.1.12)</title>
      <statement>
        The inverse of a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix seems to have determinant <m>1</m>
        all the time:
        <me>
          \det(A^{-1}) = \det \frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{pmatrix} d &amp; -b \\
          -c &amp; a \end{pmatrix} = \frac{ad-bc}{ad-bc} = 1.
        </me>
        What is wrong with this argument? What should the value of <m>\det(A^{-1})</m>
        be?
      </statement>
    </exploration>


    <exploration>
    <title>(Strang Ex 5.1.14)</title>
      <statement>
        Use row operations to reduce these matrices to upper triangular ones, then find
        the determinants:
        <me>
          \det\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 6 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\
          0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 7 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{ and } \quad
          \det\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1 \\
          0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}.
        </me>
        <sage>
        	<input>
        	C=matrix(4,4,[1,2,3,0,2,6,6,1,-1,0,0,3,0,2,0,7])
        	D=matrix(4,4,[2,-1,0,0,-1,2,-1,0,0,-1,2,-1,0,0,-1,2])
        	</input>
        </sage>
      </statement>
      
    </exploration>


    <exploration>
    <title>(Strang Ex 5.1.15)</title>
      <statement>
        Use row operations to simplify and compute these determinants:
        <me>
          \det\begin{pmatrix} 101 &amp; 201 &amp; 301 \\
          102 &amp; 202 &amp; 302  \\ 103 &amp; 203 &amp; 303
          \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{ and } \quad
          \det\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; t &amp; t^2 \\ t &amp; 1 &amp; t \\
          t^2 &amp; t &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}.
        </me>
        <sage>
        	<input>
        	B=matrix(3,3,[101,201,301,102,202,302,103,203,303])
        	</input>
        </sage>
      </statement>
    </exploration>


    <exploration>
    <title>(Strang Ex 5.1.23)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>A = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 4 &amp; 1 \\ 2 &amp; 3
          \end{smallmatrix} \right)</m> and that <m>\lambda</m> is some number.
          Find <m>A^2</m>, <m>A^{-1}</m> and <m>A-\lambda I</m> and their determinants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which two numbers <m>\lambda</m> lead to <m>\det(A-\lambda I) = 0</m>?
        </p>
        <sage>
        	<input>
        	A = matrix(2,2,[4,1,2,3])
        	</input>
