    			<p>
    				Suppose the N on the left is written in regular 12-point font. Find a matrix <m>A</m> that will transform the N into the letter on the right, which is written in italics with 16-point font. Work with someone sitting nearby (if you want) and write out your solution and approach. What assumptions do you notice yourself/your group making? What questions do you have?

    			Explain why <m>T(\mathbf{0}) = \mathbf{0}</m> for any linear transformation <m>T</m>. Further justify that translation is not a linear transformation of the plane <m>\R^2</m>.

    			As you might imagine, linear transformations are foundational to how computers display and manipulate images. However, we must engage in some mathematical trickery to translate images across the screen.
    			Read the discussion immediately preceding <url href="http://merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/ula/sec-transforms-geom.html">Activity 2.6.4</url>.
    			Then work through the problems presented there.

    <title>Nov. 24: The Matrix of a Linear Transformation</title>
    
    <exploration>
      <statement>
        Find a basis <m>\mathcal{B}</m> for <m>\R^2</m> such that the transformation <m>T: \R^2\to \R^2</m> given by
        
        <me>
          T(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix} 5 &amp; -3\\ -7 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{x}
        </me>
        
        under the basis <m>\mathcal{B}</m> is diagonal.

      <statement>
        As it turns out, we can also use matrices to describe linear transformations between non-euclidean spaces using <term>coordinates</term>. Let's see how using differentiation <m>D: \mathbb{P}_2 \to \mathbb{P}_2</m> of quadratic polynomials as an example.
        
        <ol>
          <li>Consider the general quadratic <m>ax^2 + bx + c</m>. Why can the subspace <m>\mathbb{P}_2</m> of quadratics be represented by the basis <m>\mathcal{B}=\{x^2, x, 1\}</m>?</li>
          <li>What is the image under <m>D</m> of each of the basis vectors?</li>
          <li>Under the basis <m>\mathcal{B}</m>, what is the coordinate vector that describes a general quadratic?</li>
          <!-- <li>Let's consider the derivative of a general quadratic to live in <m>\mathbb{P}_2</m> under the same basis <m>\mathcal{B}</m>. What is the coordinate vector of the <emph>derivative</emph> of a general quadratic?</li> -->
          <li>What are the coordinates of the basis vectors? How about their images under <m>D</m>?</li>
          <li>Verify that when the matrix for <m>D</m> is applied to the coordinate vector for <m>x^2 - x -1</m> that the coordinate vector for <m>2x-1</m> is obtained.</li>
        </ol>
