    			<p>
    				Suppose the N on the left is written in regular 12-point font. Find a matrix <m>A</m> that will transform the N into the letter on the right, which is written in italics with 16-point font. Work with someone sitting nearby (if you want) and write out your solution and approach. What assumptions do you notice yourself/your group making? What questions do you have?

    		<statement>
    			Explain why <m>T(\mathbf{0}) = \mathbf{0}</m> for any linear transformation <m>T</m>. Further justify that translation is not a linear transformation of the plane <m>\R^2</m>.

    		<statement>
    			As you might imagine, linear transformations are foundational to how computers display and manipulate images. However, we must engage in some mathematical trickery to translate images across the screen.
    			Read the discussion immediately preceding <url href="http://merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/ula/sec-transforms-geom.html">Activity 2.6.4</url>.
    			Then work through the problems presented there.
