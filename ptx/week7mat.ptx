    <title>SageMath and the Nullspace</title>

    <p>
      The main idea in this section is to get solutions to homogeneous
      systems <m>Ax=0</m> by using the reduced row echelon form. This will
      compute the nullspace of the matrix <m>A</m>. SageMath has some useful built-      in commands for this. Let us explore an example.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        A = matrix(QQ, 3,4, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]); A
      </input>
      <output>
        [ 1  2  3  4]
        [ 5  6  7  8]
        [ 9 10 11 12]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      The most direct way is to ask SageMath for the nullspace. But SageMath doesn't
      call it that. It uses the synonym <term>kernel</term>. Also, because we
      do matrix vector multiplication with vectors on the right, we have to
      tell SageMath to do it that way.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        A.right_kernel()
      </input>
      <output>
        Vector space of degree 4 and dimension 2 over Rational Field
        Basis matrix:
        [ 1  0 -3  2]
        [ 0  1 -2  1]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      Notice that SageMath returns the nullspace by specifying a basis. This is
      a complete set of special solutions! How can we be sure?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's check that those vectors are actually in the nullspace. This command
      should return two zero vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        sage1 = vector([1,0,-3,2])
        sage2 = vector([0,1,-2,1])
        A*sage1, A*sage2
      </input>
      <output>
        ((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0))
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      Remember that the method to find the reduced row
      echelon form is <code>.rref()</code>.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>A.rref()</input>
      <output>
        [ 1  0 -1 -2]
        [ 0  1  2  3]
        [ 0  0  0  0]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      What this means is that the null space is described by the two equations
      <me>
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{rrrrrrrrr}
        v &amp; &amp; &amp; - &amp; y &amp; - &amp; 2 z &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
          &amp; &amp; x &amp; + &amp; 2y &amp; + &amp; 3 z &amp; = &amp; 0
        \end{array}\right.
      </me>
      That is, the nullspace is the intersection of these two hyperplanes in
      <m>\mathbb{R}^4</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        # Let's see what Sage's solve command tells us:
        v,x,y,z = var('v x y z')
        expr1 = v - y - 2*z == 0
        expr2 = x + 2*y + 3*z == 0
        solve([expr1, expr2], [v,x,y,z])
      </input>
      <output>
        [[v == 2*r5 + r6, x == -3*r5 - 2*r6, y == r6, z == r5]]
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      Aha! SageMath is trying to tell us that the pivot variables <m>v</m>
      and <m>x</m> should be
      written in terms of the free variables <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>.
      Strang's "easy way out" is to choose the free variables to be
      <m>0</m>'s and <m>1</m>'s in
      combination. Here we have two of them, so we will alternate.
      One special solution will be to choose <m>y = 1</m> and <m>z=0</m>.
      Then we solve to get <m>v = 1</m> and <m>x = -2</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        special1 = vector([1,-2,1,0])

        # let's check
        A*special1
      </input>
      <output>
        (0, 0, 0)
        (0, 0, 0)
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      Similarly, we can choose <m>y=0</m> and
      <m>z=1</m> to get a second special solution. This leads to
      <m>v=2</m> and <m>x = -3</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        special2 = vector([2,-3,0,1])

        #let's check
        A*special2
      </input>
      <output>
        (0, 0, 0)
      </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
      These two vectors form a <term>basis</term> for the nullspace. Every
      vector in the nullspace can be written as a linear combination of
      these two vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is weird is that SageMath always wants its basis to look
      like <m>1</m>'s and <m>0</m>'s at the beginning, and our process makes
      them look like that at the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we be sure everything lines up?  Well, it is possible to
      express the two vectors that SageMath gives us as a linear combination
      of the ones we just found, and vice versa. So we are getting <em>two</em>
      descriptions of the same space.

    <title>SageMath and Solving General Systems</title>

    <p>
      SageMath has many built-in methods for solving systems of linear equations.
      We will investigate three common ones with a single example considered
      several times.
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        A = matrix(QQ, 3,4, [1,0,2,3, 1,3,2,0, 2,0,4,9])
        b = vector([2,5,10])
        print(A)
        print(b)
      </input>
      <output>
        [1 0 2 3]
        [1 3 2 0]
        [2 0 4 9]
        (2, 5, 10)
      </output>
    </sage>
	
	    <subsubsection>
      <title>Method One: RREF and the Nullspace</title>

      <p>
        First we find a particular solution.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>
          X = A.augment(b, subdivide=True).rref()
          X  # this subdivide thing is pretty handy!
        </input>
        <output>
          [ 1  0  2  0|-4]
          [ 0  1  0  0| 3]
          [ 0  0  0  1| 2]
        </output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        This clearly has three pivots, and all belong in the original matrix.
        So there will be a solution. We pull out the particular solution.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>
          xp = vector([-4, 3, 0, 2])
          xp
        </input>
        <output>
          (-4, 3, 0, 2)
        </output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        Since we typed that in by hand, we should check our work.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>A*xp == b</input>
        <output>True</output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        Now we need to find the nullspace and the special solutions.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>A.right_kernel()</input>
        <output>
          Vector space of degree 4 and dimension 1 over Rational Field
          Basis matrix:
          [   1    0 -1/2    0]
        </output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        The basis has only one row, so there is only one special solution.
        This matches our expectation. Our system is <m>3\times 4</m> and has
        rank <m>3</m>. So there is only one free column, and hence only one
        special solution.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>
          s1 = vector([-2, 0, 1, 0])
          A*s1 == 0
        </input>
        <output>True</output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        Now we can check the <q>general solution</q>.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>
          t = var('t')
          gensol = xp + t * s1
          gensol
        </input>
        <output>
          (-2*t - 4, 3, t, 2)
        </output>
      </sage>
      <sage>
        <input>
          A*gensol == b
        </input>
        <output>
          True
        </output>
      </sage>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Method Two: A SageMath built-in</title>
      <p>
        SageMath has a built-in method that looks like <q>Matrix division</q>. Here
        we <q>left divide</q> by the matrix. This is odd notation, and is just
        something SageMath allows.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>A\b</input>
        <output>(-4, 3, 0, 2)</output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        It is weird, but this works even if <c>A</c> is not invertible, like now.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>A.inverse()*b</input>
        <output>
          Error in lines 2-2
          Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
          ArithmeticError: self must be a square matrix
        </output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        The downside to this particular method is that in only gives you one
        particular solution. It does not produce the complete solution. You have
        to do that bit for yourself, maybe like the above.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Method Three: Another SageMath Built-in</title>
      <p>
        Finally, SageMath will also try to solve the system if you apply the
        <c>.solve_right()</c> method to <c>A</c>. You have to supply the vector
        <c>b</c> as an argument to the command.
      </p>
      <sage>
        <input>A.solve_right(b)</input>
        <output>(-4, 3, 0, 2)</output>
      </sage>
      <p>
        Again, this only pulls out a single particular solution. It is up to you
        to figure out the rest.
      </p>
